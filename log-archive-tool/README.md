### Scheduling the Log-Archive Tool with Cron

There is also the ability to automate the log archiving at regular intervals with `crontab`, should you wish to do that, follow these steps:

1. **Give execute permissions to the script:**
   ```bash
   chmod +x /home/username/log-archive.sh

2. **Add a Cron job**: Open the crontab file:
```bash
crontab -e
```

3. **Schedule the script**: For example, to run the tool daily at 02:00, add the following line in crontab:
```bash
0 2 * * * /home/username/log-archive.sh /path/to/logs
```
