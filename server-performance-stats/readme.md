# Projects Goal

Goal of this project is to write a script to analyse server performance stats.


# Requirements

>You are required to write a script server-stats.sh that can analyse basic server performance stats. You should be able to run the script on any Linux server and it should give you the following stats:

- Total CPU usage
- Total memory usage (Free vs Used including percentage)
- Total disk usage (Free vs Used including percentage)
- Top 5 processes by CPU usage
- Top 5 processes by memory usage
 

**Stretch goal**: Feel free to optionally add more stats such as os version, uptime, load average, logged in users, failed login attempts etc.

# How to Use It

To use the `server-stats.sh` script, follow these steps:

1. Log in to your server
2. Copy the code from the file `server-stats.sh`
3. Run `sudo nano server-stats.sh`
4. Paste the copied code into the file.
5. Save the file by pressing `Ctrl + X`, then `Y`, and `Enter`.
6. Change the file permissions by running `chmod +x server-stats.sh`.
7. Run the script on you Linux machine using the following command `./server-stats.sh.`
