# Projects Goal

Goal of this project is to write a script to analyse server performance stats.


# Requirements

>You are required to write a script server-stats.sh that can analyse basic server performance stats. You should be able to run the script on any Linux server and it should give you the following stats:

- Total CPU usage
- Total memory usage (Free vs Used including percentage)
- Total disk usage (Free vs Used including percentage)
- Top 5 processes by CPU usage
- Top 5 processes by memory usage
 

**Stretch goal**: Feel free to optionally add more stats such as os version, uptime, load average, logged in users, failed login attempts etc.

# Usage

To use the `server-stats.sh` script, follow these steps:

1. Ensure the script has execution permissions. If not, you can add them with the command:
    ```sh
    chmod +x server-stats.sh
    ```

2. Run the script on your Linux server using the following command:
    ```sh
    ./server-stats.sh
    ```
